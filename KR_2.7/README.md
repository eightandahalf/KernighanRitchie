Exercise 2 - 7. Write a function invert(x, p, n) that returns x with the n bits that begin at
position p inverted(i.e., 1 changed into 0 and vice versa), leaving the others unchanged.

what should we get as the result?
let x = 100, p = 4, n = 4
x in bin look like this x = 100 = 0110(0100)
since indexing starts at 0, and the number of bits n is 4, 
and the initial index is p = 4, we must invert the bits, that are 
in parentheses in x
